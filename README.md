# Simple Interest Calculator Web Application

In this project I developed a web application that calculates interest earned based on amount deposited and chosen interest rate and number of years.

Using Javascript, the output paragraph, marked in yellow, appears only when all requested valuees are entered and chosen and are correct.

Through this project I practiced my further improved skills in HTML and CSS and my newly developed skills in JavaScript.
